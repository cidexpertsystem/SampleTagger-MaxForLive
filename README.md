# SampleTagger-MaxForLive
System for tagging and filtering of audio samples using MaxForLive &amp; Ableton Live 9.0.

This MaxForLive plugin is a comprehensive system for tagging and filtering of audio samples to allow for easy categorization of a large number of short audio clips. Traditionally, audio library organization is accomplished by placing individual files in subfolders in an often complex folder structure. The limitation of this method is that an individual sample can only appear in one folder, and therefore have to be given only a single category tag. Using this plugin, cultiple tags can be aplied to each sample, and the samples may be organized in any directory structure under the specified root folder. 

For composition purposes, the complete sample collection can be searched using multiple tags and the resulting subset of matching samples will be displayed in the plugin window. The samples can then be previewed in this window, and dragged into an audio track once the desired set of hits is determined.
